# BLeeds ðŸ©¸ 

BLeeds is an IO for Blender, with scripts designed around the Leeds Engine file formats. It is a work-in-progress reverse engineering of the model file formats for Stories games, as well as Manhunt 2, and Chinatown Wars.
Currently, the scripts supports Stories (PS2 & *partially* PSP), as well as MH2 - although due to it being a WIP, I would suggest running the scripts in Blenders scripting console if you wish to try. 
However, if you are not a reverse engineerer, you probably won't be able to help much. Feel free to still try it so far, though.




Mainly keeping work here on Github right now so I dont forget(WORK IN PROGRESS).
